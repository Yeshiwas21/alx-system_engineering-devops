# Web Stack Outage Postmortem

## Issue Summary:

**Duration:**
- Start Time: January 21, 2024, 10:00 AM (UTC)
- End Time: January 21, 2024, 2:00 PM (UTC)

**Impact:**
The web service experienced a 2-hour outage affecting 20% of users. Users reported slow response times, and some functionalities were completely unavailable.

**Root Cause:**
The outage was caused by a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, leading to an uneven distribution of traffic and subsequent server overload.

## Timeline:

- **Issue Detection:**
  - Detected at January 21, 2024, 10:00 AM (UTC) through monitoring alerts indicating a spike in server response times.

- **Actions Taken:**
  - Investigated server logs to identify potential application issues.
  - Assumed an increase in traffic due to marketing campaigns, leading to server overload.
  - Explored database performance as a possible bottleneck.

- **Misleading Paths:**
  - Initially focused on application-level issues, delaying identification of the misconfiguration.
  - Assumed database performance issues without validating the load balancer settings.

- **Escalation:**
  - Escalated the incident to the DevOps and Infrastructure teams after ruling out application and database concerns.

- **Resolution:**
  - Identified the misconfiguration in the load balancer settings causing uneven traffic distribution.
  - Immediately adjusted load balancer settings to evenly distribute traffic across servers.
  - Monitored server response times to ensure stabilization.

## Root Cause and Resolution:

**Root Cause:**
The misconfiguration in the load balancer settings led to an uneven distribution of traffic, overloading certain servers while leaving others underutilized.

**Resolution:**
Adjusted the load balancer settings to evenly distribute traffic among servers. This ensured a balanced workload and prevented server overload.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:

**Improvements/Fixes:**
1. Implement automated periodic checks for load balancer configurations.
2. Enhance monitoring alerts to include specific details about load balancer performance.
3. Conduct regular load testing to simulate traffic spikes and identify potential configuration issues.

**Tasks:**
1. **Automated Load Balancer Checks:**
   - Implement a script to periodically check and validate load balancer configurations.
   - Integrate the script into the monitoring system for real-time alerts on misconfigurations.

2. **Enhanced Monitoring Alerts:**
   - Update monitoring alerts to provide detailed information on load balancer performance.
   - Include specific metrics such as traffic distribution and server response times in alert notifications.

3. **Regular Load Testing:**
   - Schedule regular load testing sessions to simulate various traffic scenarios.
   - Analyze load testing results to proactively identify and address potential configuration issues.

By implementing these measures, I aim to prevent similar outages in the future and ensure the continuous reliability and performance of our web services.
